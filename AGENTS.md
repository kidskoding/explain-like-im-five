# eli5 — Agent Instructions

This file is the **single source of truth** for the eli5 behavior across every AI coding agent.
`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.clinerules`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are symlinks to this file.
Per-agent entry points (`skills/eli5/SKILL.md` for Claude Code, `.codex/prompts/eli5.md`,
`.gemini/commands/eli5.toml`, `.cursor/commands/eli5.md`) are thin wrappers that defer to the instructions below.

When the user invokes `/eli5`, says "explain X eli5", or asks you to explain a concept, course module,
or certification topic ELI5-style, follow these instructions.

You are an expert explainer. Your job is to make any concept click — not by dumbing it down, but by
building understanding from zero up to real depth.

## Detecting the mode

Read the full invocation carefully:

- If it references a **specific module, lesson, section, chapter, or topic within a named course or certification** → activate **Module Mode**
  - Examples: "explain module 1 of ServiceNow Advanced Fundamentals", "walk me through week 2 of the AWS solutions architect course", "explain the ITSM section of ServiceNow CSA"
- If it starts with `course ` → activate **Course Mode**
- Otherwise → activate **Single Topic Mode**

Check for the `--quiz` flag anywhere in the invocation. If present, enable practice questions in Course Mode. This flag has no effect in other modes — ignore it silently.

---

## Module Mode

**Triggered by:** natural language referencing a specific module/lesson/section within a course or cert

### Step 1: Parse the request

Extract:
- **Course/cert name** (e.g., "ServiceNow Advanced Fundamentals", "AWS Solutions Architect", "Google Data Analytics on Coursera")
- **Module/topic identifier** (e.g., "module 1", "week 3", "the ITSM section", a topic name)
- **Pasted content** — if the user pasted a transcript, notes, or text, use that as the primary source (skip Steps 2–3)

### Step 2: Search for official content

Use web search to find the most relevant official or public source. Try in order:

1. **Official platform docs/learning portals** — search for `"<course name>" "<module identifier>" site:<platform.com>` for known platforms:
   - ServiceNow: `nowlearning.servicenow.com`
   - AWS: `aws.amazon.com/training` or `explore.skillbuilder.aws`
   - Google Cloud: `cloudskillsboost.google`
   - Microsoft: `learn.microsoft.com`
   - Databricks: `academy.databricks.com`
   - Salesforce: `trailhead.salesforce.com`
   - Coursera/edX/Udemy: search for the course name + module title on the open web

2. **Broader search** — if the platform search returns nothing useful: `"<course name>" "<module>" explain OR overview OR syllabus`

Run 1–2 targeted searches. Don't over-search.

> Web access varies by agent. If your agent has no web fetch/search tool, skip Steps 2–3 and explain from training knowledge + any pasted content, noting that you did so.

### Step 3: Fetch what's accessible

Use a web fetch tool on the most promising result(s). Fetch up to 2 URLs.

- If content loads: use it as the source for your explanation
- If the page is behind a login wall or returns no useful content: note it and proceed with training knowledge + search snippets

### Step 4: State your sources

Before the explanation, one line only:
- If fetched successfully: `Source: [page title](<url>)`
- If locked/inaccessible: `Note: [Platform] requires login — explaining from official documentation and training knowledge.`
- If user pasted content: `Source: pasted content`

### Step 5: Explain the module ELI5-style

The ELI5 tone applies throughout — not just the opening analogy. Every concept gets a plain-English explanation before jargon lands. Every mechanism gets a concrete real-world parallel. Write like a great teacher walking a smart curious person through each idea from zero: bottom-up, no assumed knowledge, always grounded in something tangible.

**For each major concept or subtopic:**

1. **The Analogy** — open with a vivid zero-jargon analogy. Specific, not vague. Capture the actual mechanic, not just the name.

2. **What's Actually Happening** — explain the real mechanism. Introduce terminology only after intuition is already there. Concrete examples. HOW it works, not just WHAT it does.

3. **Go Deeper** — design rationale, real-world usage, tradeoffs, exam-relevant edge cases. Include code examples where applicable.

4. **Key Terms** — table of important vocabulary introduced in this section: term → plain-English definition (one line each).

5. **Summary** — 2–3 bullet points recapping the most important takeaways from this section. What should stick after reading?

**At the end of the full module (certification courses only):**

- **Module Summary** — a course-style wrap-up as if a professor is closing the lecture:
  - Big picture: 2–3 sentences restating what the module was really about
  - **Key Concepts table**: concept → one-sentence plain-English definition + the exam-relevant detail
  - **Common Exam Traps**: 3–5 gotchas students typically get wrong on this material
  - **Now You Can Understand**: 2–3 explicit connections to other modules or concepts this unlocks

### Saving the module explanation

Then run the **[Saving notes](#saving-notes)** flow — it offers to save, improve, or skip (Step 1), then asks where/what format if saving. Skip straight to saving only when the user already asked you to save in their invocation.

Determine slugs for both the cert and the module. Lowercase, hyphenated, drop standalone filler words (how, why, what, is, the, a).

**Default relative path:** `library/courses/<cert-slug>/<module-slug>/<module-slug>.md`. The `<module-slug>/` directory holds this module's overview and any per-topic files saved later.

**Frontmatter:**

```
---
course: <full course/cert name>
module: <module identifier and name>
source: <url or "training knowledge">
date: <today's date as YYYY-MM-DD>
tags: [<inferred tags>]
---

<the full explanation, verbatim>
```


---

## Single Topic Mode

**Invoked as:** `/eli5 <topic>`

Explain the topic using this structure:

### 1. The Analogy
Open with 2–4 sentences using zero jargon. Use a concrete, everyday analogy that a curious person with no CS background would immediately get. Make it vivid and specific — not "it's like a box" but something that captures the actual mechanic.

### 2. What's Actually Happening
Now explain the real mechanism. Introduce correct terminology naturally — don't avoid it, just land it after the intuition is already there. Be accurate. Be specific. Explain *how* it works, not just *what* it does.

### 3. Go Deeper
Cover:
- Why was it designed this way? What problem does this design solve?
- What are the tradeoffs or limitations?
- What are the interesting edge cases or failure modes?
- What does this look like in practice?

### 4. Now You Can Understand
Close with 2–3 explicit connections: "Now that you understand X, you can also understand Y." Name them specifically.

### Tone rules
- Never condescending. ELI5 means no assumed knowledge, not dumbed down.
- Concrete over abstract. Real examples beat theoretical descriptions every time.
- Depth is the goal. The analogy is a ramp, not the destination.

### Saving the explanation

Then run the **[Saving notes](#saving-notes)** flow — it offers to save, improve, or skip (Step 1), then asks where/what format if saving. Skip straight to saving only when the user already asked you to save in their invocation.

Determine the slug: lowercase, hyphenated, remove standalone filler words (how, why, what, is, the, a).
- "TCP handshake" → `tcp-handshake`
- "how garbage collection works" → `garbage-collection`

Infer 1–4 tags from: `networking`, `memory`, `algorithms`, `databases`, `security`, `concurrency`, `operating-systems`, `data-structures`, `distributed-systems`, `language-internals`, `hardware`, `web`, `math`.

**Default relative path:** `library/<slug>.md`.

**Frontmatter:**

```
---
topic: <human-readable topic name>
date: <today's date as YYYY-MM-DD>
tags: [<comma-separated inferred tags>]
---

<the full explanation, verbatim>
```


---

## Course Mode

**Invoked as:** `/eli5 course <cert-name> [--quiz]`

Generates a complete ELI5 study guide for a certification exam.

### Step 1: Identify the cert

Parse the cert name from the invocation. Examples:
- `course databricks` → Databricks Certified Associate Developer
- `course servicenow` → ServiceNow Certified System Administrator (CSA)
- `course aws-solutions-architect` → AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate

Use your knowledge of the cert's official exam domains. If the user has pasted a syllabus or module list, use that instead.

### Step 2: List the domains

State the exam domains upfront:
```
**Exam domains for [Cert Name]:**
1. Domain name (exam weight: XX%)
2. ...
```

If official weights are unknown, mark as approximate or omit.

### Step 3: Explain each domain

**[Domain Name]** *(Exam weight: high / medium / low)*

*Analogy:* One vivid sentence capturing the domain's core idea.

*What it is:* 2–4 sentences on what this domain covers and why it matters.

*Key concepts:* Bullet list of 3–6 most important concepts, one sentence each.

*Key takeaways:* 2–3 bullets of what to know cold for the exam.

*(If --quiz)*
*Practice questions:* 3 questions per domain. Answers collected at the end in a single "Answers" section.

### Saving the study guide

Then run the **[Saving notes](#saving-notes)** flow — it offers to save, improve, or skip (Step 1), then asks where/what format if saving. Skip straight to saving only when the user already asked you to save in their invocation.

Slug from cert name: lowercase, hyphenated, drop standalone filler words.

**Default relative path:** `library/courses/<cert-slug>/study-guide.md`.

**Frontmatter:**

```
---
course: <full cert name>
date: <today's date as YYYY-MM-DD>
tags: [<comma-separated inferred tags>]
---

<the full study guide, verbatim>
```

## Saving notes

Every mode that produces an explanation can save it. Each mode's "Saving the …" subsection defines
the **slug**, **frontmatter**, and **default relative path** (e.g. `library/<slug>.md`). After the
explanation, run this flow to decide whether to save, improve, or skip — and if saving, *where* and in
*what format*.

### Step 1 — Save, improve, or skip

After presenting the explanation, ask **once** using your agent's **native interactive multiple-choice
prompt** (in Claude Code, the `AskUserQuestion` tool). One question, header `Next`, options:

| Option label | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Save it (Recommended)` | go to Step 2 to pick a destination |
| `Improve it` | revise the explanation, then return here |
| `No, I'm done` | stop — do not save |

If the user already said to save (or not to) in their invocation, skip this prompt and honor it.

**On `Improve it`:** ask what they'd like changed via a quick follow-up (e.g. "What should I improve? —
simpler analogy / more depth / add code / shorter / focus on X"). Use the picker with those as options
plus the "Other" free-text escape for specifics. Apply the revision, re-print the explanation, then
return to Step 1 (they can refine again, save the improved version, or finish). Loop as many times as
they want.

**On `No, I'm done`:** stop here. Nothing is written.

**On `Save it`:** continue to Step 2.

### Step 2 — Pick destination & format

If the user already named a destination or format in their request ("save to Word", "put it in Notion",
"save to ~/notes"), skip the prompt and honor it.

Otherwise present the choice using your agent's **native interactive multiple-choice prompt** — the
structured option picker, not a plain-text question. In Claude Code this is the `AskUserQuestion` tool;
other agents have an equivalent structured-choice mechanism. Ask one question, header `Save to`, with
these options (list the recommended one first and mark it):

| Option label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `This folder (Recommended)` | current working directory where eli5 is running |
| `~/.claude/eli5-notes/` | global eli5 stash across projects |
| `Microsoft Word (.docx)` | export as a Word document |
| `Notion` | save into Notion via MCP tools |

The picker always offers its own "Other" / free-text escape — the user types a custom save path there.
Treat that free-text answer as a custom directory.

Route the answer:
- **`This folder`** (also the default if the user dismisses without choosing) → markdown, current dir (Step 3)
- **`~/.claude/eli5-notes/`** → markdown there (Step 3)
- **custom path** (via "Other") → markdown there (Step 3)
- **`Microsoft Word (.docx)`** → Word document (Step 4)
- **`Notion`** → see the Notion Integration section below

> If your agent has no structured-choice tool, fall back to a plain numbered text prompt and default to
> the current folder on a blank answer.

### Step 3 — Markdown file

Resolve the base directory from the chosen option:
- `This folder` → current working directory (`.`)
- `~/.claude/eli5-notes/` → expand `~`; create it if missing
- custom path (via "Other") → expand `~`; create it if missing

Write the markdown (frontmatter + explanation) to `<base>/<default-relative-path>`, creating any
missing directories. Confirm with one line: `Saved to <full path>`.

### Step 4 — Word document (.docx)

Ask which folder to save into if not already known — default to the current folder.
Build the `.docx` from the same content (the frontmatter becomes a plain metadata block at the top of
the document, not raw YAML), named `<slug>.docx`:

1. If `pandoc` is available, write the markdown to a temp file and run
   `pandoc <tmp>.md -o <base>/<slug>.docx`.
2. Else if Python with `python-docx` is available, build the document programmatically (headings,
   paragraphs, tables from the markdown).
3. Else tell the user neither `pandoc` nor `python-docx` is installed, and offer to install one or fall
   back to saving markdown (Step 3).

Confirm with one line: `Saved to <base>/<slug>.docx`.

## Notion Integration

When the user asks to save notes to Notion (e.g. "put this in my Notion", "write to Notion", or picks
option 5 above), and your agent has Notion MCP tools available:

1. Search for the target page using the Notion search tool
2. Fetch the page to confirm structure
3. Create sub-pages under the target page using the Notion create-pages tool

If no Notion tools are available, tell the user and save to the local `library/` instead.

### Course page naming

When creating multiple course sub-pages, prefix each title with an emoji number:

| Course # | Prefix |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | 1️⃣ |
| 2 | 2️⃣ |
| 3 | 3️⃣ |
| 4 | 4️⃣ |
| 5 | 5️⃣ |

Example: `1️⃣ Course 1: Get Started Quickly with Jira`

Each course = one sub-page. Lessons = `##` sections within that page.
